Rock, paper, scissors!

Hello! again..

So this one is a little more existing since I'm actually learning something, and
not checking if I remember CSS and HTML from 2 years ago, so this one is fun!

Again this is a project from The Odin Project curriculum, from someone in the 
remote lands of Mar del Plata.


Bye!
